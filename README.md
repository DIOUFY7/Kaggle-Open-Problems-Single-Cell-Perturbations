The goal of this competition is to predict how small molecules change gene expression in different cell types.

Public score 0.610 and the first had 0.523.

I won 227 on private leadboard and my score was 0.789 and the first had as score 0.729.

But I had not time to submit my work to the jury. 

I did my work with google colab and Kaggle.

I used:

RegressorChain,MultiOutputRegresso with LGBMregressor, BayesianRidge
CNN, Resnet, MLPregressor, randomforest, deep neural network 

Tpot Stackingestimator, tpotregressor

kernalPCA, TruncatedSVD


Combine models
